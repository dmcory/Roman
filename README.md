# [Roman](https://github.com/dmcory/Roman)
VB Library for convert integer numbers to roman

And well, that's it.

You need to add this project to your project (or take the dll generated)

And then
```
Imports roman
```

For usage you need something like this:
```
Dim number = (New roman_numbers).ToRoman(4999)
```

and the function will return the roman symbols in string.
